# ADC Potentiometer

This code will read the value of the voltage divider using the ADC in attiny10 from a potentiometer and blinks the LED faster the closer it is to ground ref. 

## Setup

Connect your LED like the blink example folder. Then you can connect VCC to one of the outer pin of the potentiometer, and ground to the other outer pin of the potentiometer. Then connect PB1 to the middle pin of the potentiometer.
